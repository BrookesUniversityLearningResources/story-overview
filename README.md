Next step is to implement [&lt;StoryOverview/&gt;](./src/components/StoryOverview/StoryOverview.tsx).

There are some stub stories in the [/src/stories/](./src/stories/) folder that you can use in the implementation: to change which canned story you're using edit the [&lt;App/&gt;](./src/App.tsx) component.
